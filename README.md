# Computer Vision Hero To Zero

> "Collaboration allows us to know more than we are capable of knowing by ourselves." â€“ Paul Solarz

## Main Focus
The main focus is on covering the latest developments in the computer vision domain, from the basics to the state-of-the-art.

## Areas of Exploration
We will explore the computer vision domain in the following manners:
- Generative AI
- [x] Stable Diffusion Inference Using the Diffusers library
- [ ] Style GANs Inference
- [ ] Fine-tune both models on custom dataset
- 3D Computer Vision
- Detection, Tracking, and Segmentation in 2D and 3D
- Exploring the State-of-Art Concepts

## References
During this journey, multiple internet resources will be referred to, and they will be mentioned here in an organized way.

## Note
In the future, I plan to add more topics to my Area of Exploration. The first step is to become familiar with the basics of these topics, which will help us build a strong foundation for further learning and development.
## Usage

To create the conda environment, use the `environment.yaml` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create the conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```

3. Activate the conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate your_environment_name
    ```

Replace `your_environment_name` with the name specified in the `environment.yaml` file.

Make sure to save the changes to the README.md file.
